If there’s no controller, no API layer, then you’re likely working on:

Backend workers/services (like Kafka consumers, schedulers, cron jobs, message processors)

Or internal libraries/modules used by other apps

Possibly even batch jobs or data pipelines


That’s why it feels like:

> “What the hell is this app even doing?”

Here's how to understand such apps:

1. Search for @KafkaListener, @Scheduled, CommandLineRunner, ApplicationRunner

These are entry points in non-API apps.

Example:

@KafkaListener(topics = "some-topic")
public void consume(String message) {
    ...
}

or

@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * *")
public void runJob() {
    ...
}


---

2. Check main method (SpringBootApplication)

Sometimes they trigger runners or consumers from there.


---

3. Look for listener, consumer, job, or processor packages

These contain the real logic triggers — not Controller but something like:

UserEventProcessor.java

AccountSyncListener.java



---

4. Check application logs or bootstrap

Often the logs say:

> "Starting XYZService..."
"Consuming from topic..."
"Batch Job Started..."



Match that with classes.

5. Ask this to your team (1 simple question):

> “Hey, what triggers this app? Is it Kafka, cron, or some input file? Just trying to understand the flow.”
